# React Machine Coding Challenges 🧠⚛️

This repository contains a collection of small React projects built using **Vite**. Each folder is a self-contained project that focuses on a particular UI pattern, logic puzzle, or coding challenge — useful for interviews, practice, and improving your frontend problem-solving skills.

---

Each folder:

- Is bootstrapped with `Vite`
- Contains its own `package.json`
- Can be run independently

---

## 🚀 Running a Project

```bash
cd <project-folder>
npm install
npm run dev

cd simple-todoapp
npm install
npm run dev
```
